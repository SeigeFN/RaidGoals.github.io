<p>The science involved in Interstellar is grounded in reality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Christopher Nolan worked closely with a team of scientists to ensure the scientific concepts involved were as accurate as possible, which helps it be not only visually stunning, but also scientifically acceptable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The movie released in 2014:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is facinating when considering the first ever picture of a black hole, which was taken in 2017, 3 years after the films release. Compare <a target=”_blank” title="Black hole from Interstellar" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/interstellarfilm/images/9/9b/Black_hole.png/revision/latest?cb=20150322005003">Interstellar</a> vs <a target=”_blank” title="First ever picture taken of a black hole" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Horizon_Telescope#/media/File:Black_hole_-_Messier_87_crop_max_res.jpg">Event Horizon Telescope</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>CGI:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new CGI software was created just to be able to accomodate the scientific calculations of the black hole, just to be able to accuratly simmulate and generate the required images.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The space suits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The space suits worn by the crew of the endurance durring their voyage actually worked as space suits. They came with many of the same features of real space suits, such as water cooling. All in all, the suits weighed between 30 to 35 pounds!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Location:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While significant CGI was used, that doesnt mean that the entire movie was greenscreen. The cast shot internationally to capture the perfect atmosphere. The crew travled all over Iceland, and even had 500 acres of corn planted in Alberta just to get the screen right, without using greenscreen or more CGI.</p>
